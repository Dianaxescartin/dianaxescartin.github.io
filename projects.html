                        The project consisted in creating a web page with information about myself, 
                        and inserting an image of the Code: You logo. For this project I used HTML language 
                        in the VS code IDE. As well, I used a version control system known as Git and 
                        stored it in GitHub trough git commands in a Bash terminal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The purpose of this project was learning the correct use of semantic HTML tags. 
                        Using git to clone a GitHub repository and getting a previous HTML file with 
                        several div tags, to correct with appropriate semantic tags using the VS code IDE.
                    </p>

                        In this project Python was used to create a .txt file. 
                        The information in the .txt file was collected with some inputs 
                        from the user and then put together with the f-string.
