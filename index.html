                    <h3>About me</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was an accountant specializing in taxes. I’m from Mexico, and 
                        three years ago I moved to Louisville when I got married. 
                        I took this as an opportunity to learn something new and change my career, 
                        so I currently study programming at Code You, with a web development pathway. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I always wanted to help animals in my community in Mexico, but 
                        I didn’t have enough time to do it, so now I’m active as a volunteer at a cat rescue, 
                        and I would like to foster cats in the future.
                    </p>
